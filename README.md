# Tractorbeam


## Open source multi-tier website backups

[Tractorbeam](https://tractorbeam.me/) is a Docker container that can back up your entire website from a variety of hosts to S3-compatible object stores like AWS S3, [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/?refcode=5fb69d9c62e4), Google Cloud Storage, Ceph Object Storage, and more.  All libraries and utilities are built in to the container, so there's nothing more you need. For more information, visit [tractorbeam.me](https://tractorbeam.me/).


## Using Tractorbeam

Run the single shot container on your own infrastructure, see [tractorbeam.me/setup](https://tractorbeam.me/setup/) for details.
